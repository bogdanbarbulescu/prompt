## üîß Local Setup

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bogdanbarbulescu/prompt.git
    cd prompt
    ```


2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    *   Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
    *   **Note:** Due to browser security restrictions (`CORS`) when using the `fetch` API to load `prompts.json`, the prompts might not load if you open the file directly from your local filesystem (`file:///...`).

3.  **Use a Local Server (Recommended for `fetch` to work):**
    *   **If you have Node.js installed:** Run `npx serve` in the project directory and navigate to the provided `http://localhost:....` address.
    *   **If you have Python 3 installed:** Run `python -m http.server` in the project directory and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
    *   **Using VS Code:** Install the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live".

##  kullanƒ±m

1.  **Dashboard:** The initial view shows summary statistics and cards for each prompt category. Click a category card to navigate directly.
2.  **Sidebar:** Use the sidebar to navigate between the Dashboard and different prompt categories.
3.  **Category View:** Displays all prompts within the selected category.
    *   Click the copy icon (üìÑ) in a prompt card header for a quick copy.
    *   Click anywhere else on the prompt card to open the detailed modal view.
4.  **Search:** Use the search bar in the header. As you type, relevant prompt titles will appear as predictions. Click a prediction to open that prompt in the modal.
5.  **Modal:**
    *   View the original prompt.
    *   Modify the prompt in the "Customize Prompt" textarea.
    *   Use the "Reset Input" button to revert changes.
    *   Use the "Search on..." buttons to open the *current* text in the textarea in a new tab for the respective AI service.

## ‚ûï Adding/Modifying Prompts

Prompts are managed centrally in the `prompts.json` file located in the root directory.

1.  **Locate `prompts.json`**.
2.  **Structure:** The file is a JSON object where keys represent categories (`data-category` attribute in HTML) and values are arrays of prompt objects.
3.  **Prompt Object Format:** Each prompt object within a category array should follow this structure:
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Your Concise Prompt Title",
      "prompt": "The actual prompt text, potentially using {placeholders}.",
      "language": "language-name" // e.g., "text", "python", "javascript", "sql", "markdown" - for Prism.js highlighting
    }
    ```
4.  **Add/Edit:** Add new objects to the appropriate category array or modify existing ones. Ensure valid JSON syntax (commas between objects, correct brackets/braces).
5.  **Add Category:** To add a new category:
    *   Add a new key-value pair to `prompts.json` (key = category name, value = array of prompt objects).
    *   Add a corresponding list item (`<li>`) to the `<ul class="sidebar-list">` in `index.html`, making sure the `data-category` attribute matches the JSON key. Choose an appropriate Material Icon.
6.  **Save `prompts.json`**.
7.  **Refresh** the application in your browser (or commit/push if using GitHub Pages).
